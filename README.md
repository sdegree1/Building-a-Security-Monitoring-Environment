Project Summary:

Use the skills that you've learned in the Defensive Security unit and design a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization, VSI. On Day 1, you'll use Splunk to research and design a monitoring solution for the fictional organization. On Day 2, you'll determine whether that monitoring solution will protect the organization from several simulated attacks. On Day 3, you'll showcase your defensive project with a presentation to the class.
